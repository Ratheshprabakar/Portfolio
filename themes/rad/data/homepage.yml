I still wonder how a person in 20 become a synonym for professionalism.He is a talented technician and an effective supervisor. I have worked with him as a placement representative. Although our collaboration lasted for few months only, I learnt his capability of turning the process of cooperation into an engaging victory. I highly recommend Rathesh as a professional that you can learn a lot from."
